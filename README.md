# What's that Pokemon?: Feature Extraction for Image Classification
##### Machine Learning project by Elijah Justin Medina

Usual image classification use images as direct input to convolutional layers in order to predict a target variable. In some cases, it may be enough to manually extract features from the images through image processing since the resulting model will be more interpretable. In this project, features like color and size information are extracted from images of Pokemon in order to classify their type. The results show varying accuracies as different types of Pokemon are more predictable with the engineered features than others.
