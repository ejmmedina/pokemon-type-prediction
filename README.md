# Calculator, The Game: A Reinforcement Learning approach
##### Machine Learning 2.0 project by Elijah Justin Medina

The goal of this project is to build a reinforcement learner that can transform a given integer into a target integer using a set of actions (e.g. addition, multiplication).
With an initial problem of building a reinforcement learner for data wrangling, the project is an initial attempt for processing integers. Multiple rules and trials show difficulties of the model to converge to a solution, mainly due to the wide range of states that the agent can be in.

##### Future analysis and possible improvements

As next steps, other rule sets should be explored (different rewards and punishment systems) or other methodologies aside from Q-Learning can be used for the project.

##### Report and analysis

The full report is included in the Jupyter notebook. If you have any questions regarding this study, please send me a message via <a href="mailto:elijahjustinmedina@gmail.com">e-mail</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijah-justin-medina/">LinkedIn</a>.
